## AVR Basics using Arduino UNO and C in Linux environment


* GPIO exercise: Blink three lights and change the blinking direction using two switches. 
* UART exercise: Transmitting and receiving between Arduino and a computer using a keyboard and a button 
* Analogue to digital conversion: Change the tone of a buzzer by the light sensitivity with a photonsensor. Control the on-off with a switch
* Timer and interrupt: Control the frequency of buzzer noise by the input value(allows between 100-8000Hz only) we type in with a keyboard. 
* Transmission to OpenEEG software: send a 6-Channel binary Data Packet over the Uart.
